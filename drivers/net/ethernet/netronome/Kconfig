config NET_VENDOR_NETRONOME
	bool "Netronome(R) devices"
	default y
	---help---
	  If you have a Netronome(R) network (Ethernet) card or device, say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Netronome(R) cards. If you say Y, you will be
	  asked for your specific card in the following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_NETRONOME

config NFP
	tristate "Netronome(R) NFP4000/NFP6000 NIC driver"
	depends on PCI && PCI_MSI
	depends on VXLAN || VXLAN=n
	---help---
	  This driver supports the Netronome(R) NFP4000/NFP6000 based
	  cards working as a advanced Ethernet NIC.  It works with both
	  SR-IOV physical and virtual functions.

config NFP_DEBUG
	bool "Debug support for Netronome(R) NFP4000/NFP6000 NIC drivers"
	depends on NFP
	---help---

	  Netronome(R) NFP4000/NFP6000 NIC drivers.
